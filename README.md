# C-Matrix-Rain
C program for Linux operating systems that simulates the Matrix rain effect for a couple of seconds and then quits automatically. 
In case it does not work try to rebuild the program. Therefore type (within your project folder)

  make clean
  
to delete the binaries and

  make 
  
to build the program again. In order to run it type

  ./bin/main
